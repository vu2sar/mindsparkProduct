<h3>Why are we asking for parents' email IDs?</h3>
<p>The new Mindspark Parent Connect allows parents to see what their children are doing in Mindspark. The Parent Connect is easily accessible to those parents whose email IDs have been registered with Mindspark. Registered parent email IDs also make it easier for teachers to communicate directly with parents, through the "Mail Parents" option on the Mindspark Teacher Interface.</p>
<p>[Mindspark treats all personal information including email IDs as privileged information. It will be used solely for mailing Mindspark related communications.]</p>
